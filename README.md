# Matter Kit - Shortcodes
**A plugin for setting up basic shortcodes.**

## Installing the plugin
Install this plugin as you would other WordPress plugins, but uploading the directory to the plugins folder, or downloading the zip and uploading through the WordPress GUI.

## Shortcodes
**Phone Numbers**
The phone numbers is pulled from a global custom field, which means we can use the one phone number in multiple places throughout the content and update it easily, in one place. 
```[mttr_phone_number tel="true"]```
To filter out spaces for the tel: protocol, add the optional argument tel="true".

**Fax Numbers**
The fax number is pulled from a global custom field, which means we can use the one phone number in multiple places throughout the content and update it easily, in one place. 
```[mttr_phone_number tel="true"]```
To filter out spaces for the tel: protocol, add the optional argument tel="true".

**Email Addresses**
The email address is pulled from a global custom field, which means we can use the one email address in multiple places throughout the content and update it easily, in one place. 
```[mttr_email_address]```
